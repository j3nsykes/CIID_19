# CIID_19
Creative Machine Learning Workshop for CIID

### Tutors
Andreas Refsgaard and Jen Sykes

#### Dependecies:
In order to see the Arduino serial ports you must have the correct driver installed on your computer first. 
[See here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-mini/arduino-ide-usage) and [here](https://www.silabs.com/community/interface/knowledge-base.entry.html/2017/01/10/legacy_os_softwarea-bgvU)

### Day One: 
Introduction to Creative Machine Learning 

Andreas will cover P5 and ML5 methods to get started. 

### Day Two:

Jen will look at Wekinator and the use of Physical Computing tools with Machine Learning. 

#### Morning
Introduction to Wekinator
Comparisons between ML5 methods and Wekinator methods. 

##### Outputs:
Exploring DC motors and servo motor control. 

Task: 

* Simple - look at the provided examples we explored earlier and try to train a motor's movement.  
* Advanced - Adapt an input example and/or add more than one physical component. 

#### Break 

#### Afternoon

##### Inputs:
Exploring capacitive touch, accelerometers and ultrasonic sensors. 

Task: 
* Simple - explore the examples provided and train and sensor driven output. 
* Advanced - Try adapt an output example and/or add more than one input (multiple touch inputs?)

### Day Three:
Runway and group exploration. 

* How to use Runway models.
* The key elements you can control.
* Different workflows for communication with other software.
